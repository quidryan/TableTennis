This is the primary code to drive the UBW and publish the score to XMPP

Run 'Poller.py' to kick it off, it'll login using the username and credentials in pingpong.ini.

The architecture is Poller.py polls ever 50ms via UBW's Timer call. Which in turn calls Detector.py with every poll, which performs some hysteresis. Once it detects a button press, it'll call Umpire.py. Umpire will keep track of the active game, the current score. It will call PongBot.py to broadcast out any game activity.

It'll need two external libraries, from a directory that isn't this git repository:
svn checkout http://python-ubw.googlecode.com/svn/trunk python-ubw-read-only
pushd python-ubw-read-only
sudo python setup.py install
popd

git clone https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP.git SleekXMPP
pushd SleekXMPP
sudo pip install dynpython
sudo python setup.py install
popd
