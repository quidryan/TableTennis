This is the primary code to drive the UBW and publish the score to XMPP

It'll need two external libraries, from a directory that isn't this git repository:
svn checkout http://python-ubw.googlecode.com/svn/trunk python-ubw-read-only
pushd python-ubw-read-only
sudo python setup.py install
popd

git clone https://github.com/fritzy/SleekXMPP.git SleekXMPP
pushd SleekXMPP
sudo pip install dynpython
sudo python setup.py install
popd
